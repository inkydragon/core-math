# The CORE-MATH project

CORE-MATH Mission: provide on-the-shelf open-source mathematical
functions with correct rounding that can be integrated into current
mathematical libraries (GNU libc, Intel Math Library, AMD Libm,
Newlib, OpenLibm, Musl, Apple Libm, llvm-libc, CUDA libm, ROCm).

## Quick guide

### Exhaustive checks

To run an exhaustive check of a single-precision single-argument
function, run:

    ./check.sh --exhaustive [rounding_modes] $FUN

where:
- `$FUN` can be `acosf`, `asinf`, etc.
- `[rounding_modes]` can be a selection of `--rndn` (round to
  nearest), `--rndz` (toward zero), `--rndu` (upwards), `--rndd`
  (downwards). The default is all four.

This command is sensitive to the following environment variables:
- `CC`
- `CFLAGS`
- OpenMP variables such as `OMP_NUM_THREADS`

Note: on Debian, you need the libomp-dev package to use clang.

### Worst case checks

These checks are available for bivariate single-precision functions,
and double-precision functions.

    ./check.sh --worst [rounding_modes] $FUN

### Special checks

These checks are available for functions where some interesting worst
cases can be automatically (and cheaply) computed (at the time of
writing, only `hypotf` and `cbrt`).

    ./check.sh --special [rounding_modes] $FUN

### Performance measurements

Performance measurement scripts rely on the Linux perf framework. You
might need to run the command:

    echo -1 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid

as root before running the following commands.

To evaluate the reciprocal throughput of some function, run:

    ./perf.sh acosf

It outputs two numbers: the performance of core-math, and the one the
libc, in cycles/call. You can also evaluate the performance of some
other libm (given by a static .a archive, typically llvmlibc), by
setting the `LIBM` environment variable to the absolute path of the .a
file. In the case, `./perf.sh` will output three numbers: the
performances of core-math, standard libm, given libm.

To evaluate performance of all supported functions, run:

    ./perf-all.sh

You can also set the `PERF_ARGS` environment variable to `--latency`
to get latency instead of reciprocal throughput.

When you run ./perf.sh acosf, it does the following:

   $ export OPENMP=-fopenmp
   $ cd src/binary32/acos
   $ make clean
   $ make CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native"
   $ ./perf --file /tmp/randoms.dat --reference --count 1000000
   $ perf stat ./perf --file /tmp/randoms.dat --count 1000000 --repeat 1000

and it reports the number of cycles given by perf (divided by 10^9).

## Layout

Each function `$NAME` has a dedicated directory
`src/$TYPE/$SHORT_NAME`, where `$TYPE` can be `binary{32,64,80,128}`
and `$SHORT_NAME` is the function name without its type suffix
(`acos`, `asin`, etc.). This directory contains the following files:
- `$NAME.c`: a standalone implementation of function `cr_$NAME`
- other support files


## How to add support for a new function?

You can take inspiration from a similar function of the same bitsize
and/or arity.

For example, suppose you want to add support for a binary64 bivariate
function `foo`. In `src/binary64/foo`, you will need the following
files:
- `foo.c`: defining `cr_foo`
- `foo.wc`: the worst cases to be tested
- `foo_mpfr.c`: defining `ref_foo`, using MPFR
- `Makefile`: defining `FUNCTION_UNDER_TEST`, and including `../support/Makefile.bivariate`
- `function_under_test.h`: defining `{cr,ref}_function_under_test`

In addition, in `src/generic/foo`, you will need the following file:
- `random_under_test.h`: defining a function `random_under_test`,
  which samples suitable inputs for `foo`

## Support of underflow

CORE-MATH always supports underflow, with the rule of "underflow after
rounding": if the rounded result (with unbounded exponent range) is in
the subnormal range, then underflow is raised. Otherwise underflow is
not raised.

## Support of errno

The support for errno is provided with -DCORE_MATH_SUPPORT_ERRNO
(not activated by default). The value of errno is set to ERANGE in
case of overflow or of underflow (following the "underflow after
rounding" rule).

## Notes

The CORE-MATH code assumes all double-precision computations are rounded to
double precision. On x86 processors where these computations are performed
on the x87 FPU, the user should set up the rounding precision to double
precision (on Linux it is set to double-extended by default).

There might be some contradictions between correct rounding and some optional
requirements of the POSIX standard. In such a case, CORE-MATH chooses to
return the correctly rounded result.
